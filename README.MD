**Observations:**

* The sentiment of Indians towards the possible recession of 2023 appears predominantly negative, as indicated by a significant number of negative sentiment tweets.

* Among the tweets analyzed, a noteworthy proportion expressed positive sentiment (17.58%), a small fraction remained neutral (0.51%), while the majority conveyed a negative sentiment (81.91%).

* It is worth highlighting that positive sentiment tweets feature keywords such as 'growth', 'witty', 'strong', 'hiring', and 'better', reflecting an optimistic outlook on India's economic future.

* In contrast, negative sentiment tweets prominently mention keywords like "inflation", "recession", "China", "Russia", "USA", and "Europe", underscoring the significant influence of these factors on the potential economic recession. For instance, factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, economic blockades by the USA and Europe, and conflicts with China contribute to the prevailing negative sentiment.
